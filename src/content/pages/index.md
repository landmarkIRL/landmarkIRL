title: Landmark in Real Life
---

This is a chronicle of the lives of my friends and former classmates from Landmark University.
It follows their journeys after graduation, spotlighting the cool and inspiring things they’re achieving.
My circle leans more towards tech, but a number of them are in art, fashion, and other fascinating fields.
Most of them are going to do big things. You’ll read about them here first.
