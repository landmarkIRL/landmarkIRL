## Why I Started This

After graduation, I started noticing something. My coursemates from Landmark started doing some seriously impressive things. Not just the usual job updates, but real, standout work in tech, design, fashion, media, and more. Some were building products, launching brands, or quietly excelling in ways that deserved more attention. I couldn’t stop thinking about how inspiring it was to watch them grow, and how most people had no idea any of it was happening.

So I started this blog. LandmarkIRL is where I document those stories where people from our set (mostly) get their flowers while the work is still fresh. It’s not about hype, it’s about keeping track. A record of where we go, what we build, and who we’re becoming.

## What You'll Find Here

Real stories, real decisions, and the roads people are taking after leaving school. That includes:

* **Profiles:** One-on-one stories about people you probably sat next to in class. What they’re doing now, and why.
* **Wins:** Launches, milestones, promotions, risks taken and paid off.
* **Paths:** Not everyone’s story is straight or shiny. That’s part of what makes them worth telling.

## Why It Matters

I’m doing this because I think we underestimate how much we can learn from each other. Some of the people I knew in school are now doing work that genuinely pushes me to level up. If it’s happening to me, it’ll probably happen to you too. This is just a space to make sure it’s seen.

## How You Can Be Part of It

* **Read and share** what resonates.
* **Send in names**, yours or others. If you or someone you know is building something meaningful, I want to hear about it.
* **Reach out** through [davidumou.me](https://davidumoru.me/)
